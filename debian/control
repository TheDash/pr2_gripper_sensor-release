Description: The pr2_gripper_sensor_msgs package contains various actions and messages that are used in the pr2_gripper_sensor* packages. The structure of the API used by pr2_gripper_sensor_action, and pr2_gripper_sensor_controller packages is as follows: Users will send a goal to an Action in the message format of PR2Gripper*Command (where * replaces the name of the particular Action from pr2_gripper_sensor_action). Feedback and Result information for the action is then returned in the format of PR2Gripper*Data.
