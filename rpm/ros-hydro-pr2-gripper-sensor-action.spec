%description
The pr2_gripper_sensor_action package provides an action interface for talking
to the pr2_gripper_sensor_controller real-time controller. It provides several
different actions for getting high-level sensor information from the PR2 palm-
mounted accelerometers, fingertip pressure arrays, and gripper motor/encoder, as
well as several sensor-based gripper control actions that respond with low-
latency in real-time.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
