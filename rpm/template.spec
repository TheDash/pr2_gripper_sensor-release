%description
The pr2_gripper_sensor_controller package is a real-time controller that
integrates signals from the PR2 hand-mounted accelerometer and finger-mounted
pressure sensors with motor control of the gripper joint to do highly responsive
sensing and low-latency closed-loop control.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
